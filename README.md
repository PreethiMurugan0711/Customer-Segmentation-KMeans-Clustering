Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering (Day 4)
📌 Project Overview
This project applies Unsupervised Machine Learning to group customers of a retail mall based on their spending habits and annual income. This type of segmentation helps businesses create targeted marketing strategies for different customer groups.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Libraries: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Algorithm: K-Means Clustering.

Optimization: The Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (K).

📊 Key Steps Implemented
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions of Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

The Elbow Method: Plotting Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) to find the "elbow" point for optimal clustering.

Modeling: Training the K-Means algorithm with the identified number of clusters.

Visualization: Creating 2D or 3D scatter plots to show how customers are grouped.
